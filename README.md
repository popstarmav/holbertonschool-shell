## About Me
I'm [Your Name], a software engineer passionate about systems programming. Connect on [LinkedIn](your-linkedin-url), [X](your-x-url), or my [Portfolio](portfolio-repo-url).

## Project Overview
This repository showcases shell scripts for automating Linux tasks like permissions, I/O redirection, and process monitoring, built to enhance my command-line expertise.

## My Development Journey
Debugging signal handling in `processes_and_signals` was tough until I mastered `trap`. This project taught me to write efficient, readable scripts.

## Features
**Implemented:**
- File renaming scripts (`basics`)
- Permission automation (`permissions`)
**Future:**
- CLI tool integration

## Key Challenges
- Mastered piping with `tee` in `io_redirections_and_filters`.
- Optimized loops with `awk` for speed.

## Getting Started
1. Clone: `git clone https://github.com/popstarmav/holbertonschool-shell.git`
2. Run: `bash basics/script.sh`
