#Loops, Conditions, and Parsing in Holbertonschool-Shell
This directory contains shell scripts that explore loops, conditional statements, and data parsing, helping me master control flow and text processing in Bash.

## About Me

## Project Overview
The loops_conditions_and_parsing directory features scripts that tackle control structures and parsing tasks in Bash. From printing "Best School" with different loops (1-for_best_school, 3-until_best_school) to parsing Apache logs (13-lets_parse_apache_logs), these scripts helped me understand how to automate repetitive tasks and process structured data effectively.

## My Development Journey
I initially struggled with the while loop in 2-while_best_school because I forgot to increment my counter—leading to an infinite loop! Parsing Apache logs in 13-lets_parse_apache_logs was another challenge; I had to learn awk to extract fields like IP addresses and timestamps. These experiences taught me the power of combining loops, conditionals, and parsing tools like cut and awk.

## Features
**Implemented:**
Loop-based printing (1-for_best_school, 2-while_best_school, 3-until_best_school) for repetitive tasks.
Conditional logic (5-4_bad_luck_8_is_your_chance) to print messages based on numbers.
File parsing (11-read_and_cut) to extract fields from /etc/passwd.
Log analysis (13-lets_parse_apache_logs) to process Apache access logs.

## Key Challenges
Infinite Loops: Forgetting to increment the counter in 2-while_best_school taught me to double-check loop conditions.

Parsing Complexity: Using awk in 13-lets_parse_apache_logs to extract log fields was tricky until I understood field separators.

Conditional Logic: Writing 10-fizzbuzz required careful modulo checks to handle "Fizz", "Buzz", and "FizzBuzz" cases.

## Getting Started
1. Clone: `git clone https://github.com/popstarmav/holbertonschool-shell.git`
