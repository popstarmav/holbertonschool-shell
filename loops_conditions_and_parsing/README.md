# Loops, Conditions, and Parsing

This repository contains shell scripts that demonstrate the use of loops, conditional statements, and data parsing techniques in Bash. These scripts showcase fundamental control flow structures and text processing capabilities essential for shell scripting.

## Description

This project focuses on mastering control structures and text processing in Bash, covering:
- Different types of loops (for, while, until)
- Conditional statements (if, case)
- File testing and manipulation
- Text processing using tools like awk, cut, and grep
- Log file parsing and analysis

Each script demonstrates specific aspects of Bash programming, from basic loop structures to more complex data parsing operations.

## Requirements

- All scripts are designed to be run on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- All scripts are executable (`chmod +x script_name`)
- All scripts pass shellcheck without any errors
- The first line of all scripts is `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
- A comment explains what each script does

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/holbertonschool-shell.git
```

2. Navigate to the directory:
```bash
cd holbertonschool-shell/loops_conditions_and_parsing
```

3. Make the scripts executable (if they aren't already):
```bash
chmod +x *
```

4. Run any script:
```bash
./script_name
```

## Key Concepts

- **Loops**: Repeating commands with for, while, and until loops
- **Conditionals**: Making decisions with if statements and case statements
- **File Operations**: Testing file attributes and manipulating file content
- **Text Processing**: Extracting and transforming data from text files
- **Regular Expressions**: Pattern matching for text processing
- **Log Analysis**: Techniques for parsing and analyzing log files

## Examples

Print "Best School" 10 times using a for loop:
```bash
./1-for_best_school
```

Implement the FizzBuzz algorithm:
```bash
./10-fizzbuzz
```

Extract user information from /etc/passwd:
```bash
./11-read_and_cut
```

Parse Apache access logs:
```bash
./13-lets_parse_apache_logs
```
